    "Python provides various standard data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integers=> It is the positive or negative numeric value without the decimal. For ex- 45, 23, 10, 5\n",
    "2. Float=> It represents the real number and It is the positive or negative numeric value with the decimal. It represents the              fractional values in the decimal form. For ex- 56.5, 89.0, 7.1, 10.7\n",
    "3. String=> String is literal text or values enclosed in the quotes. For ex- \"Good\", \"Hey\", \"John Cena\", \"Brock Lesnar\"\n",
    "4. Boolean=> Boolean values are the two constant objects False and True. They are used to represent truth values and values in              case of boolean are either True or False. For ex- Check whether (9>45), It's false.\n",
    "5. Set=>  Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Set is a collection which is both unordered and                     unindexed.Sets cannot have two items with the same value. For ex- Myset = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"}\n",
    "6. Dictionary=> Dictionaries are used to store data values in 'key:value' pairs.A dictionary is a collection which is ordered,                changeable and does not allow duplicates. Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and                      values. For ex- Mydict = {\"brand\": \"Tesla\", \"model\": \"X\", \"year\": 2020} \n",
    "7. Tuple=> Tuples are identical to lists in all respects, except for the following properties. Tuples are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses (()) instead of square brackets ([]). Tuples are immutable. For ex- Fruits = ('Grapes', 'Mango', 'banana', 'Peach', 'Pineapple', 'dragonfruit')\n",
    "8. List=>In short, a list is a collection of arbitrary objects, somewhat akin to an array in many other programming languages but more flexible. Lists are defined in Python by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of objects in square brackets ([]), as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "=>The important characteristics of Python lists are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are ordered.\n",
    "Lists can contain any arbitrary objects.\n",
    "List elements can be accessed by index.\n",
    "Lists can be nested to arbitrary depth.\n",
    "Lists are mutable./n\n",
    "Lists are dynamic. For ex- a = ['car', 'bar', 'buzz', 'clan']\n",
